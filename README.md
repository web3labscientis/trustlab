🧪 Project Name: TrustaLab

Tagline: “Secure Results. Verified Trust.”

 Overview
TrustaLab is a decentralized health data verification and payment platform built on the Hedera network. It ensures that every medical test result is securely stored, tamper-proof, and easily verifiable by patients, healthcare providers, and laboratories — bringing trust, transparency, and accountability to medical diagnostics.


💡 Problem Statement
In many parts of Africa, fraudulent or altered lab test results have led to wrong diagnoses, poor treatment, and mistrust between patients and health institutions. Existing verification systems are centralized, insecure, and lack transparency.

 Solution
TrustaLab leverages Hedera DLT to secure and verify medical test results.

Each uploaded test result is hashed and stored on the Hedera ledger.

Patients and hospitals can verify results instantly using a unique ID or QR code.

Built-in Web3 payment support allows instant crypto payments (HBAR/stablecoins) for laboratory services.


⚙️ Core Features

✅ Blockchain Verification – Test results are hashed and recorded on Hedera for authenticity.

✅ QR & ID Verification – Patients or institutions verify data using unique codes or QR scan.

✅ Crypto Payments – Pay for lab services using Hedera-compatible wallets.

✅ Admin Panel – Hospitals upload and track verified test records.


🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript

Blockchain: Hedera JS SDK

Wallet: HashPack (integration structure implemented, pairing pending)

Hosting: Vercel

Version Control: GitHub



 Current Stage

> The front-end, Hedera SDK structure, and wallet integration logic are fully set up.
HashPack wallet connection is partially implemented — UI and event handlers ready, awaiting final SDK handshake debugging.
The demo includes result upload, verification, and QR features simulated on client-side.


Future Roadmap

Complete wallet pairing & transaction signing on Hedera Testnet

Deploy smart contracts for payment verification

Implement data analytics dashboard for hospitals

Launch pilot with real labs in Nigeria and Africa at large
